Assalamualaikum I created this desktop application using C#(100% done by me). so, let's get into the full application, </b><br>

This is the main interface for login to all users (admin, host, guest). By default, admin username and password are admin.<br>

but if you are a guest or host first you must go through the registration process<br>

Ho- (host registration) and Gu- (guest registration) are used for identifying guest or host directly. <br>
